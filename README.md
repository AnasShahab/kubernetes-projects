## nginx
> This project demonstrates how to deploy a customized NGINX application on Kubernetes, complete with custom error pages, ingress routing via both Traefik and NGINX controllers, and a fallback mechanism for handling failures or direct IP access. It also includes a test pod for validating service connectivity.

## mongodb
> This Kubernetes setup deploys a secure MongoDB database alongside the Mongo Express web-based admin interface, enabling easy database management. It includes an Ingress resource that routes external HTTP traffic from mongodb-app.com to the Mongo Express service, allowing convenient browser-based access via Traefik.
